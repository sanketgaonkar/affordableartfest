        <strong>Returns</strong><br>
        Goods once sold will not be accepted as a return by the museum.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Refunds (if applicable)</strong><br>
        Only those goods that are damaged during transit will be considered for a refund. Once your refund application is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your application. We will also notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund.
        <br>
        If you are approved, then your refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied to your credit card or original method of payment, within a certain amount of days.
        <br>        
        <br><strong>Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</strong><br>
        If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted.
        <br>
        Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us at [mail@museumofgoa.com]
        <br>
        <br><strong>Sale items (if applicable)</strong><br>
        Unfortunately sale items cannot be refunded. (i.e. items sold at discounted rates)
        <br>
        <br><strong>Exchanges (if applicable)</strong><br>
        We only replace items if they are defective or damaged while in transit. If you need to exchange it for the same item, send us an email at [mail@museumofgoa.com] and we will send you the postal details, should your request be accepted.
        <br>
        <br><strong>Shipping</strong><br>
        We will take the responsibility of insuring the work for delivery purposes. You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for the purchased item. (Shipping costs are non-refundable). If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.
